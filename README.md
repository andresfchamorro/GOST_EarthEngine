# GOST_EarthEngine

This repository contains resources and examples of our use of Google Earth Engine. So far, our implementations focus on the following tasks:

1. Zonal Statistics
    - *ZonalStats* (Area by land cover)
    - *ZonalStats_Monthly_Climate* (monthly statistics summarized at the district-level)
    - *TimeSeries_Vegetation* (NDVI from different sources, NPP trend)

2. Land cover classification
    - *CropClassification_BGD*
    
3. Flood detection

The training folder contains 5 scripts to get up to speed with GEE. If you're looking for a comprehensive training, we recommend looking at the [tutorials](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/ttt) developed by the Earth Engine team.
